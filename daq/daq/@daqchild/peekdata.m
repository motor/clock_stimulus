function peekdata(varargin)
%PEEKDATA Preview most recent acquired data.
%
%    PEEKDATA(OBJ,SAMPLES)
%    DATA = PEEKDATA(OBJ,SAMPLES) returns the latest number of samples 
%    specified by SAMPLES to DATA.  If SAMPLES is greater than the number of
%    samples currently acquired, all available samples will be returned 
%    with a warning message stating that the requested number of samples 
%    were not available.  OBJ must be a 1-by-1 analog input object.
%
%    DATA = PEEKDATA(OBJ,SAMPLES,TYPE) allows for DATA to be 
%    returned as the data type specified by the string TYPE.  TYPE can either
%    be 'double', for data to be returned as doubles, or 'native', for data 
%    to be returned in its native data type.  If TYPE is not specified, 
%    'double' is used as the default.
%
%    PEEKDATA is an non-blocking function that immediately returns data
%    samples and execution control to the MATLAB workspace.  Not all
%    requested data may be returned.
%
%    OBJ's SamplesAvailable property value will not be affected by the
%    number of samples returned by PEEKDATA.  This means that PEEKDATA
%    only looks at the data, it does not remove the data from the data 
%    acquisition engine.
%
%    PEEKDATA can be used only after the START command is issued and while
%    OBJ is running. PEEKDATA may also be called once after OBJ has stopped
%    running.
